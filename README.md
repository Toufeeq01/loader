# loader

The changes made are:

1>Animation Duration and Delay: The animation duration for each letter is reduced to 1.5 seconds, and each letter has a specific delay before it starts animating. This delay creates a staggered effect where each letter appears one after the other.
2>Text Shadow: Each letter has a text shadow applied to it, creating a subtle shadow effect.
3>Loader Animation: The loader animation consists of four spans positioned absolutely inside the .loader div. These spans move across the div from left to right or right to left, creating a loading effect.
4>Hover Effect: When hovering over the loader, the background color changes to black, and the box-shadow property creates a glowing effect around the loader.
These changes ensure that the text animation cycles through the word "LOADING" continuously and smoothly.
